    "**Dataset**: The dataset from Crunchbase shows characteristics of different companies that were funded all the way from the start of the 20th Century. Each company is labelled either as \"closed\", \"operating\" or \"acquired\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: As per our investigation, 90%+ of startups fail in North America, with similar rates all over the world. However, from those that do succeeed, 85% have been acquired. As a result, \"acquisition\" we aim to understand the variables/characteristics that increases the likelihood of a startup being acquired where Success = Acquired / Failure = Not Acquired\n",

    "**Scope**: For the scope of this investigation, we will concentrate on acquisitions in the 21st Century (>1999). This will provide more value to our investigation as the business world has changed a lot since the \"pre .com\" era\n"
